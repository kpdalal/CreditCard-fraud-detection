# CreditCard-fraud-detection
-The data set used for this training algorithms is https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
-This is visualized through scatter plot and bar chart for determining which algorithm to use.
-Available data is bifurcated in training set and testing set in a split of 80:20.
-The model is trained on training set using 4 ML Algorithms and the score of each algorithm is determined by using testing set data.

The ML agorithms used are:
1. LogisticRegression (solver - 'liblinear')
2. LogisticRegression (solver - 'saga')
3. LogisticRegression (solver - 'newton-cg')
4. RandomForestClassifier
